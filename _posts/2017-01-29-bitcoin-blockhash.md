The block hash defines the chain links among the block chain, as every block contains a hash of the previous block. This is visualized in Figure 1. For more contextual information I recommend the wiki's [block chain article](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain) and the developer guide's [block chain section](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#block-chain).

In this post, I want to take a look at the block hashing algorithm, its input, a serialized block header and hash byte orders.

## Input: Serialized Header

The [serialized header's](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#block-headers) 80 byte array is build up of 6 concatenated fields:

| Field | C Data Type | Format |
|-|-|
| [version](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#block-versions) number | long | little endian |
| [previous block header's hash](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#term-previous-block-header-hash) | char[32] | internal byte order |
| [merkle root hash](https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/merkle-root) over transactions | char[32] | internal byte order |
| [Unix timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) | unsigned long |  little endian |
| [target](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Target) [nBits](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#target-nbits) | unsigned long |  little endian |
| nonce | unsigned long |  little endian |

The `long` like data types are simple to serialize in [little endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Little-endian). Serialized hash character arrays in C, respectively byte arrays in Python, are not affected by endianness. For an explanation I refer to the section "When endianness affects code", in [this](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-endianc/) IBM developerWorks article. We still have to get the hash byte order right.

Hashes in the bitcoin world get represented in two different [byte orders](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#hash-byte-order):

1. _Internal_ byte order: the 'normal' byte order in which any SHA-256 implementation will return its output is used with serialized blocks and headers. A [hashlib's](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html) `sha256` object for example.
2. _RPC_ byte order: the _byte-wise reverse_ of the internal order is used by the Bitcoin Coreâ€™s [RPCs](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#remote-procedure-calls-rpcs) and [block chain browsers](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain_browser).

A block chain browser like the [Block Explorer](https://blockexplorer.com) website is the easiest way to browse some header elements from the actual block chain. Figure 2, below, shows the site for the block at height 447569. Its 'BlockHash' is presented in _RPC_ byte order.

The Python `bytes` object below is initialized with the serialized block header at height 447569. The hashes are in _internal_ byte order.

```py
# Serialized block header at height 447569
serhead447569 = bytes.fromhex(
    "00000020\
    bb9d883e59fdb50bbe66bede526eb3741547a16467af1b000000000000000000\
    3947840edb1a5f4e7d5be5a6a125dbbdaaf7ea12e70320661d17168c93fc5ff1\
    017a7558\
    79430318\
    6053336d")
```

In Python, conversion between the two orders can be realized by slicing with step width `-1`.

```python
inthash = blockhash(header)
rpchash = inthash[::-1]
```



The function below serializes a block header from value types as returned from the Block Explorer [API](https://blockexplorer.com/api-ref):

```python
from struct import pack, unpack

def serheadblockexp(
        version: int,
        prevblockhash: str,
        merkleroot: str,
        time: int,
        nbits: str,
        nonce: int) -> bytes:
    """Serialized block header from Block Explorer API Data

    Packs block header bytes from value types as returned from the Block
    Explorer API under https://blockexplorer.com/api/block/[:hash]"""
    return pack(
                "< l 32s 32s L L L",
                version,
                # hashes need to be converted from RPC to internal byte order
                bytes.fromhex(prevblockhash)[::-1],
                bytes.fromhex(merkleroot)[::-1],
                time,
                # nBits need to be unpacked from hex string into unsigned long
                unpack(">L", bytes.fromhex(nbits))[0],
                nonce)
```

## The Bitcoin Block Hashing Algorithm

As of now, the developer guide and reference have no dedicated sections about the block hashing algorithm. Admittedly, the computation itself is rather straight forward and well-described in the [wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_hashing_algorithm). The computation is defined as a double [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) [hash](https://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.180-4) over an 80 byte array, the latter being the serialized block header. We can quickly prototype this in a Python function as:

```python
from hashlib import sha256

def blockhash(header: bytes) -> bytes:
    """Block hash over serialized block header in internal byte order"""
    hash = sha256(header).digest()
    hash = sha256(hash).digest()
    return hash
```





## Testing against the Block Chain

We can test the above function against any header in the actual chain. The respective header elements we can get from any [block chain browser](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain_browser), e.g. the [Blockexplorer](https://blockexplorer.com) website. The main site always shows the most recent block, right now, this is block [#447569](https://blockexplorer.com/block/0000000000000000025f4304cbcaa71ffe257eb14e5a12303d257bed95b9c6ac).

![2016-12-28-bitexpblock447569.jpg]({{ site.url }}/assets/2016-12-28-bitexpblock447569.jpg)

This block can also be accessed in slightly more raw form by calling their [REST API](https://blockexplorer.com/api-ref) as:

```url
https://blockexplorer.com/api/block/[:hash]
```

With corresponding block hash:

```url
https://blockexplorer.com/api/block/0000000000000000025f4304cbcaa71ffe257eb14e5a12303d257bed95b9c6acj
```

The returned [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) struct contains a _lot_ of text, the list of transactions `"tx":["024b...6e51"]` has 693 entries and thus makes up most of the data presented. By shorting the `"tx"` array and structuring a bit, we get:

```json
{
   "hash":"0000000000000000025f4304cbcaa71ffe257eb14e5a12303d257bed95b9c6ac",
   "size":999125,
   "height":447569,
   "version":536870912,
   "merkleroot":"f15ffc938c16171d662003e712eaf7aabddb25a1a6e55b7d4e5f1adb0e844739",
   "tx":["024b...6e51"],
   "time":1484093953,
   "nonce":1832080224,
   "bits":"18034379",
   "difficulty":336899932795.80774,
   "chainwork":"00000000000000000000000000000000000000000037b812a69b538795d4f2e6",
   "confirmations":123,
   "previousblockhash":"0000000000000000001baf6764a1471574b36e52debe66be0bb5fd593e889dbb",
   "nextblockhash":"000000000000000000cda699b7856bac05591123eb6ad52896d50c5a22077128",
   "reward":12.5,
   "isMainChain":true,
   "poolInfo":{}
}
```

These values we need to serialize. A block [header](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#block-headers) is serialized in an 80 byte string, containing the concatenated entries:



These values are presented in easily readable formats, i.e. mostly as base-10 or hex digits.

The raw bytes we want to compute with can better be accessed by their web [API](https://blockexplorer.com/api-ref). [Here](https://blockexplorer.com/api/block/00000000000000001e8d6829a8a21adc5d38d0a473b144b6765798e61f98bd1d) we can retrieve the very same block via their API. Just click on it, your browser will show the returned [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) struct as text. A _lot_ of text, the list of transactions `"tx":["024b...6e51"]` has 693 entries and thus makes up most of the data presented. When shorting the `"tx"` array and structuring the wall of text, we get:
