# My Interest in Bitcoin Mining Technology

My interest in [bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#mining) [mining](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining) flared up again and again over the recent years. A currency founded on a cryptographic basis intrigued me from the start, combined with the ever [continuing progress](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining#The_mining_ecosystem) put into the development of miners. From generic, multithreaded CPU-targeted software implementations, over to embarrassingly parallel GPUs, then FPGAs and now to the seeming finale reached in current ASIC designs. There is also cloud mining nowadays, but they just run the ASICs for you.

The mining algorithm and most efficient implementations of it seem well researched. Further, significant performance increases through miner design seem unlikely and ongoing progress will now be based on improvements in the underlying ASIC technologies. Becoming a miner nowadays means to buy a finished product: one of the ASIC miner platforms in a package you can afford, read that as in a single ASIC, or several in parallel. These you then just hook up and run. It has become as easy as boring.

Not, that mining for an actual profit has ever been so [easy](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Profitability_Calculator)... The uncertain profitability in combination with the initial hardware investments, the large uncertainty of where it would all end up over time and the fact that I just never saw the need for an 'alternative' currency had me never actually get into bitcoin.

Bitcoin has become quite big since I first heard of it, and every time I dismissed it as 'still too esoteric' since then. The technology race and the sheer competition among miners still _fascinates_ me.

So, having decided for myself to tinker with some little projects, to actually _write_ about them and to gather them on GitHub has brought me to here. The first post of some, about my tinkering and learning process into bitcoin mining.
